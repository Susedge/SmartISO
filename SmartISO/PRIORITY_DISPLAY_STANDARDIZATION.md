# Priority Display Standardization Fix

## Issue
The priority level display across different form submission pages was inconsistent. While the admin submissions page (`submissions.php`) showed properly color-coded priority badges with ETA days, other pages like "Pending Approval", "Pending Service", "My Submissions", etc. were showing basic badges without color coding or ETA information.

## Root Cause
Different view files were using different priority display logic:
- **Admin submissions page**: Used detailed priority mapping with colors and ETA days
- **Other pages**: Simple badge display without proper color coding or ETA information
- **Controllers**: Some were not fetching the priority field from the database

## Solution
Standardized the priority display across all form submission views to match the admin submissions page format.

### Priority Mapping Standard (3-Level System)
```php
$priorityMap = [
    'high'   => ['label' => 'High',   'color' => 'danger',  'days' => 3],
    'medium' => ['label' => 'Medium', 'color' => 'warning', 'days' => 5],
    'low'    => ['label' => 'Low',    'color' => 'success', 'days' => 7]
];
```

### Files Updated

#### View Files
1. **app/Views/forms/pending_approval.php**
   - Added Priority column to table header
   - Implemented color-coded priority badges with ETA days
   - Colors: Red (danger) for high/urgent/critical, Yellow (warning) for normal/medium, Green (success) for low

2. **app/Views/forms/pending_service.php**
   - Added Priority column to table header
   - Implemented color-coded priority badges with ETA days

3. **app/Views/forms/my_submissions.php**
   - Added Priority column to table header (between Form and Status)
   - Implemented color-coded priority badges with ETA days
   - Updated colspan from 5 to 6 for "no submissions" message

4. **app/Views/forms/approved_by_me.php**
   - Added Priority column to table header
   - Implemented color-coded priority badges with ETA days

5. **app/Views/forms/serviced_by_me.php**
   - Added Priority column to table header
   - Implemented color-coded priority badges with ETA days

6. **app/Views/forms/completed.php**
   - Added Priority column to table header
   - Implemented color-coded priority badges with ETA days

#### Controller Files
**app/Controllers/Forms.php** - Updated multiple methods to fetch priority from database:

1. **pendingService()** method (line ~505)
   - Added `form_submissions.priority` to SELECT query

2. **approvedByMe()** method (line ~1194)
   - Added `form_submissions.priority` to SELECT query

3. **completedForms()** method (line ~568)
   - Added `fs.priority` to SELECT query

## Display Format
All priority badges now display as:
```
[Color Badge] Priority Name (X days)
```

Examples:
- ðŸ”´ **High (3d)** - Red badge (danger)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Medium (5d)** - Yellow badge (warning)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Low (7d)** - Green badge (success)

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All pages now show priority in the same format
2. **Visual clarity**: Color coding makes it easy to identify urgent items at a glance
3. **ETA visibility**: Users can immediately see the expected turnaround time
4. **User experience**: Approvers, service staff, and requestors all see the same priority information

## Testing
Test the following pages to verify proper priority display:
1. âœ… Forms â†’ Pending Approval (as approving_authority)
2. âœ… Forms â†’ Pending Service (as service_staff)
3. âœ… Forms â†’ My Submissions (as requestor)
4. âœ… Forms â†’ Approved By Me (as approving_authority)
5. âœ… Forms â†’ Serviced By Me (as service_staff)
6. âœ… Forms â†’ Completed Forms (all roles)
7. âœ… Admin â†’ Dynamic Forms â†’ Submissions (as admin)
