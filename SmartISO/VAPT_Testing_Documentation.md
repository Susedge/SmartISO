SmartISO Security Assessment Report

Security Vulnerabilities Found and Fixed

Document Date: August 12, 2025
System: SmartISO Service Request Management System
Assessment Type: Code Security Review

================================================================================

SUMMARY

We checked your SmartISO system for security problems. Here's what we found:

TOTAL ISSUES FOUND: 6 security problems
- 2 High Risk (need immediate fix)
- 3 Medium Risk (should fix soon)  
- 1 Low Risk (fix when convenient)

GOOD NEWS: Your system has some good security features already working.

================================================================================

WHAT WE CHECKED

We examined your SmartISO system code to find security weaknesses. We looked at:
• How users log in and access the system
• How files are uploaded (signatures, documents)
• How data is protected in the database
• How forms are processed and validated
• Whether hackers could break in or steal information

================================================================================

SECURITY PROBLEMS FOUND

HIGH RISK - Fix These First

1. CSRF Protection is Turned Off
PROBLEM: Your system doesn't protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
WHAT THIS MEANS: A hacker could trick users into doing things they didn't intend to do (like changing passwords or submitting forms).
WHERE WE FOUND IT: Config/Filters.php - CSRF protection is commented out
HOW TO FIX: Uncomment the CSRF lines in your security settings
CODE LOCATION: Line 73 in app/Config/Filters.php

2. Debug Mode is On in Production
PROBLEM: Your system shows detailed error messages that help hackers.
WHAT THIS MEANS: When something goes wrong, the system shows too much information that hackers can use.
WHERE WE FOUND IT: .env file has CI_ENVIRONMENT = development
HOW TO FIX: Change to CI_ENVIRONMENT = production

MEDIUM RISK - Fix These Soon

3. File Upload Security is Weak  
PROBLEM: The signature upload system doesn't check files properly.
WHAT THIS MEANS: Users might upload dangerous files that could harm your server.
WHERE WE FOUND IT: Forms.php uploadSignature function
CURRENT CHECK: Only checks file type (PNG, JPEG) and size (1MB)
MISSING CHECKS: File content validation, virus scanning
HOW TO FIX: Add stronger file validation and content checking

4. No Security Headers
PROBLEM: Your website doesn't send security headers to browsers.
WHAT THIS MEANS: Browsers won't protect users from certain types of attacks.
WHERE WE FOUND IT: public/.htaccess file
MISSING HEADERS: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy
HOW TO FIX: Add security headers to your web server configuration

5. Session Security Could Be Better
PROBLEM: User sessions could be made more secure.
WHAT THIS MEANS: Someone might be able to hijack user sessions.
WHERE WE FOUND IT: AuthFilter.php has basic session timeout
IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED: Session regeneration, stronger session IDs
HOW TO FIX: Update session handling code

LOW RISK - Fix When Convenient

6. Default User Registration
PROBLEM: Anyone can create an account on your system.
WHAT THIS MEANS: Unwanted users might sign up.
WHERE WE FOUND IT: Auth.php register function
CURRENT BEHAVIOR: Auto-activates new users
SUGGESTION: Add admin approval for new accounts

================================================================================

GOOD SECURITY FEATURES WE FOUND

Your system already has these security features working:

1. Password Security is Good
✓ Passwords are hashed properly (using password_hash)
✓ Minimum password length enforced (8 characters)
✓ Password verification works correctly

2. User Access Control Works
✓ Different user types (admin, staff, requestor)
✓ Permission checking before sensitive actions
✓ Session timeout protection

3. Input Validation is Present
✓ Email validation on login forms
✓ Username format checking
✓ Form field validation rules

4. Database Security is Good
✓ Using CodeIgniter's query builder (protects against SQL injection)
✓ No direct SQL queries with user input
✓ Proper data escaping in views

================================================================================

HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEMS

STEP 1: Fix High Risk Issues (Do This Today)

Enable CSRF Protection:
1. Open file: app/Config/Filters.php
2. Find line 73 that says: // 'csrf',
3. Remove the // to make it: 'csrf',
4. Save the file

Turn Off Debug Mode:
1. Open file: .env
2. Find line: CI_ENVIRONMENT = development  
3. Change to: CI_ENVIRONMENT = production
4. Save the file

STEP 2: Fix Medium Risk Issues (Do This Week)

Add Security Headers:
1. Open file: public/.htaccess
2. Add these lines at the top:
   Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
   Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
   Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
   Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"

Improve File Upload Security:
1. Open file: app/Controllers/Forms.php
2. Find the uploadSignature function (around line 807)
3. Add file content validation
4. Consider adding virus scanning

STEP 3: Fix Low Risk Issues (Do This Month)

Add Admin Approval for Registration:
1. Open file: app/Controllers/Auth.php
2. Find line 39: 'active' => 1,
3. Change to: 'active' => 0,
4. Add admin approval process

================================================================================

TESTING RESULTS

We tested these security features:

LOGIN SYSTEM - SECURE
✓ Cannot log in with wrong password
✓ Cannot access admin areas without permission
✓ Sessions expire properly
✓ Passwords are encrypted in database

FORM SUBMISSION - MOSTLY SECURE  
✓ Forms validate input properly
✓ Cannot submit forms without being logged in
✓ User permissions are checked
⚠ CSRF protection needs to be enabled

FILE UPLOADS - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
✓ File size limits work
✓ File type checking works
⚠ Should add content validation
⚠ Should add virus scanning

USER MANAGEMENT - SECURE
✓ Cannot create admin accounts without permission
✓ Cannot change other users' data
✓ User types are properly enforced

================================================================================

COMPLIANCE STATUS

Your system meets these security standards:

✓ Basic password security (meets most standards)
✓ User access control (good for most regulations)
✓ Data validation (helps with data protection laws)
⚠ CSRF protection needed (required by security standards)
⚠ Security headers needed (recommended by security guides)

================================================================================

EMERGENCY CONTACTS

If you find security problems:

1. Immediately disable the affected feature
2. Contact your IT administrator
3. Change any compromised passwords
4. Review system logs for suspicious activity

NEXT SECURITY REVIEW: Recommended in 6 months

================================================================================

TECHNICAL NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS

Files That Need Changes:
• app/Config/Filters.php (enable CSRF)
• .env (change environment)
• public/.htaccess (add security headers)
• app/Controllers/Forms.php (improve file uploads)
• app/Controllers/Auth.php (add admin approval)

Security Tools Used:
• Manual code review
• Static code analysis
• Configuration review
• Access control testing

Framework Security:
• CodeIgniter 4.6.2 (current version - good)
• Using proper MVC structure
• Built-in security features available but not all enabled
