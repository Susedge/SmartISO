# Quick Fix - Automatic Scheduling & My Schedule

## ✅ BOTH ISSUES FIXED

### Issue 1: No Automatic Scheduling Toggle
**Fixed**: Added migration to create config entries
**Location**: Admin > Configurations > System Settings
**What to look for**:
- "Auto Create Schedule On Submit" card (default: OFF)
- "Auto Create Schedule On Approval" card (default: ON)

### Issue 2: No "My Schedule" for Service Staff  
**Fixed**: Added menu item to sidebar
**Location**: Sidebar > SERVICE REQUESTS section (for service_staff users)
**Menu shows**: Pending Service | My Serviced Forms | Completed Forms | My Schedule

## Files Changed
1. `app/Database/Migrations/2026-01-04-000001_AddAutomaticSchedulingConfig.php` - NEW
2. `app/Views/layouts/default.php` - Added My Schedule menu

## Testing
✅ Migration ran successfully
✅ No syntax errors
✅ Sidebar updated for service staff

## How to Verify
1. Login as admin → Go to Configurations → System Settings tab → See two auto-schedule toggles
2. Login as service_staff → Check sidebar → See "My Schedule" link
