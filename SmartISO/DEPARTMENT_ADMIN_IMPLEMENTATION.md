# Department Admin Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a new `department_admin` role to the SmartISO system. Department admins have scoped access to manage resources only within their assigned department, while global admins retain full system access.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Changes

**Migration:** `2025-10-22-000000_AddDepartmentAdminUserType.php`
- Adds `department_admin` to the `user_type` ENUM in the `users` table

**Seeder:** `DepartmentAdminSeeder.php`
- Creates a sample department admin user assigned to the IT/Computer Studies department
- Credentials: `dept_admin_it` / `password123`
- Email: `dept_admin@example.com`

### 2. Role Permissions

#### Global Admin (admin, superuser)
- Full access to all departments, users, forms, and configurations
- Can create, edit, and delete any resource across the entire system
- Can manage department admins

#### Department Admin (department_admin)
- **Scoped to their assigned department only**
- Can manage users within their department (requestors, approving authorities, service staff)
- Can manage forms within their department
- Can configure form signatories for department forms
- **Cannot:**
  - Create or edit users outside their department
  - Create global admins, superusers, or other department admins
  - Change the department of users or forms
  - Access global system configurations (offices, global settings)

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### Filter: `DepartmentAdminFilter`
- Validates access to admin routes
- Sets session variables for department context:
  - `is_department_admin`: Boolean flag
  - `scoped_department_id`: The department ID for scoping

#### Controllers Updated
All admin controllers include department scoping logic:

**Admin\Users**
- `index()`: Filters users by department
- `create()`: Restricts department selection and user type creation
- `edit()` / `update()`: Validates department ownership and prevents privilege escalation
- `delete()`: Only superusers can delete users

**Admin\Forms**
- `index()` / `gallery()`: Shows only department forms
- `create()`: Forces forms to be created in admin's department
- `edit()` / `update()`: Validates form ownership
- `delete()`: Validates form ownership

**Admin\Configurations**
- `formSignatories()`: Restricts access to department forms only

#### Views Updated
- **admin/users/form.php**: Restricts department selection and user type options for department admins
- **admin/users/index.php**: Adds badge styling for department_admin role (dark badge)
- **layouts/admin.php**: 
  - Changes sidebar title to "Department Admin" for scoped users
  - Hides "Offices" menu item from department admins
  - Shows "Users" menu to department admins

### 4. Running the Implementation

#### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
php spark migrate
```

#### Step 2: Run Seeder
```bash
php spark db:seed DepartmentAdminSeeder
```

#### Step 3: Test the Feature
1. Login as the department admin:
   - Username: `dept_admin_it`
   - Password: `password123`

2. Navigate to admin panel - you should see:
   - "Department Admin" in the sidebar title
   - Only users from the IT department in Users list
   - Only forms from the IT department in Forms list
   - No "Offices" menu item

3. Try to create a user - you should:
   - Only see IT department in dropdown (disabled)
   - Only see requestor, approving_authority, service_staff roles (no admin/superuser/department_admin)

4. Try to edit users from other departments - you should receive an error

### 5. Security Considerations

- Department admins cannot escalate their own privileges
- All form submissions and actions are validated server-side
- Session-based department scoping prevents manipulation
- Input validation prevents department boundary crossing
- Privileged role creation is restricted

### 6. UI Consistency

The department admin UI uses the **same layout, components, and styling** as the global admin panel. The only differences are:

1. Filtered/scoped data (department-specific)
2. Hidden menu items (e.g., Offices)
3. Restricted form options (department, user types)
4. Different sidebar title ("Department Admin")

This ensures a consistent user experience while maintaining proper access control.

### 7. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future development:

- Allow department admins to view reports/analytics for their department
- Add department-specific dashboard widgets
- Enable department admins to customize department-specific settings
- Multi-department admin support (assign admin to multiple departments)
- Audit logging for department admin actions
